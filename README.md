# FantasyOptimizer

FantasyOptimizer is a Python project designed to analyze fantasy football draft data, evaluate player value, and identify draft "steals" using historical ADP and performance data.  
This refactor introduces a clean project structure, modular architecture, and support for future machine learning models.
